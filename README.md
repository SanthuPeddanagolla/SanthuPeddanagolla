## Hi there 👋

My name is Santhosh, I’m an aspiring AI/ML Engineer passionate about building data-driven solutions that create real-world impact. As a final-year student specializing in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, I’ve developed hands-on experience in machine learning, deep learning, and data analytics. 

🔬 Recently, I built a Breast Cancer Prediction system using supervised learning algorithms, focusing on early diagnosis and healthcare impact. This project helped me strengthen my skills in data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation using tools like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

🧠 Currently, I’m diving deep into the world of Generative AI — exploring models like GANs, VAEs, and transformers. I'm particularly interested in text-to-image synthesis and large language models like GPT and Stable Diffusion.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills
Languages: Python, SQL

ML Tools & Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
AI Domains: Classification, NLP, Generative Models, Computer Vision
Version Control: Git & GitHub
Other Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Colab, VS Code, Streamlit

## 📌 Featured Projects
🔍 Breast Cancer Prediction
Supervised ML model (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) to detect malignant vs. benign tumors using the Wisconsin dataset. Achieved over 95% accuracy and implemented performance evaluation metrics like confusion matrix and ROC-AUC.

🎨 Generative AI (In Progress)
Working on building image generation models using GANs and experimenting with prompt-based generation using diffusion models.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Prompt Engineering & Fine-tuning LLMs
Hugging Face Transformers
AI Ethics & Explainability
